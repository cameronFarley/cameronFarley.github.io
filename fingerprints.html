	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),  which is essentially a request from a client to a web server, acts as a middle ground for sending out information. This allows anyone with an HTTP link to access the information. However, the HTTP was not made very securely, which allowed people to get into the HTTP code and edit the responses from the computer. As a solution to this issue, a new version of HTTP was released, this time called HTTPS, with the “S” standing for secure. One purpose is to encrypt the HTTP connection for increased data transfer security to make it impossible to break, as well as block viewing of network traffic monitoring. While this made browsing secure for everyone, plenty of organizations had their fair share of complaints. This new secure way of browsing had blocked companies, schools, and other groups from administering the browsing history and traffic of their users. As a workaround to this, people began working and establishing an HTTPS Proxy, with the aim to monitor the browsing of the people in their group/organization. The found solution was to use a MITM, a Man in the Middle, which allowed companies to place themselves between the client and the server in order to eavesdrop or impersonate the application or client. This is currently seen as the best solution to working around an HTTPS, however, the risk that came with it was massive. The risk that came along with the MITM was that there was that an improper connection could result in a huge loss of important encrypted information. There is concern however with the HTTPS Proxys because many people believe that their organizations do not have a right to eavesdrop on their conversations. Now many approaches can be taken on this, but I believe that as long as you’re on the account or device provided by an organization, they should have every right to traffic you. But, I do not believe this should apply to the connection of the network, just because someone is using your network, does not give you the right to track them, especially when using a personal device.

	The way these HTTPS files are encoded is by using hashes. Hashes are functions that can map any size of data to a fixed-size value. A good hash has 2 things, quick response time, and minimizing the number of repeating outputs (collisions). This means a faster-responding site and, something else that can contribute to that is a better-organized system of information. One way to improve your HTTPS hash is by hiring a certificate authority.  A certificate authority is an organization that acts to bind websites, people, etc… to encrypted documents, known as a digital certificate.  This certificate grants authentication, encryption, and integrity with the aim to make faster and better hashes to not only make a more secure connection but to also make a faster connection. These authorities allow the organization or group that hired them to see the files and trafficking of their network, and most notably, find any tampering or monitoring of their data. Certificate authorities, or some computer software, can also be used to further encrypt an SSL, thus preventing interception by a third party, and building on top of that, looking at the files of the certificate authority can show a mismatch in public keys and certificate fingerprints, meaning someone or something has been tampering with your SSL.

	These programs are not perfect however and can lead to harmful misinformation. The first of which is a false positive: when an alert goes off that a vulnerability is present and it is not. This can lead to a shutdown in the system to prevent the vulnerability that is supposedly present, which can possibly lose data or just cause pure paranoia among the users and organization. The other harmful alarm is the false negative: when a threat is present, but no alarm goes off. This is far more dangerous due to the lack of prevention of the threat and can cause a greater loss of data than a false positive.
