      <h1>AI Sentience</h1>
    </div>

      <p class="text">
	Sentient AI is beneficial, but humanity has not yet created sentience. Sentient (/ˈsen(t)SH(ē)ənt/): ability to feel or perceive things. Every living creature that has evolved to where it is now is sentient, they have their own brains and, for the most part, are able to feel and think comprehensively. This means having their own emotions and reactions to events. After many claims of creating real Artificial intelligence, there has been no example that falls under the definition of sentience. In an article written for the New York Times by Cade Metz, he claims “[t]he notion that today’s technology is somehow behaving like the human brain is a red herring.” I fully agree with this statement because there has been no AI created, or announced publicly, to have a fully comprehensive AI, which means no hard coded responses, the ability to feel certain emotions, and having true freedom of thought. But since there is “no evidence this technology is sentient or conscious,” doesn’t mean we should try to fulfill that idea. Sentient technology can be useful in someways, yes, but they can also bring more harm than good. They would be another apex predator in the world who want to compete for being the top, controlling being of the world. Now, I know people talk about peace with the AI, however, if people cannot make peace with one another, than a whole different entity is something else. Entrusting AI with power could also be the end of humanity, and no I don’t mean the living of humans, but rather the perfection of human error. If the AI is made to not make mistakes, then that can hurt smaller or bigger businesses, the production of wants would end and everyone will focus on the production of needs. If the AI is making decisions, they will make cost efficient products and end competition between companies. Sentient AI is harmful for the economy and although we aren’t close to achieving it, I believe we should not even try.
