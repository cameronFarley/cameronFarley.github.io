      <b>1. Project Bolt</b><br>
      The idea is good at first glance, connecting computer science enthusiasts around the world. When you take a deeper dive however, you being to realize this product is already widely used. Websites like StackOverflow, Stack, and Discord already achieve this feat. This would just throw a new company into an already competitive department of the world.

      <b>2. 2D Fighting Game</b><br>
      The idea is compelling to students and is achievable. The downfall not only comes to the competition within the industry, but most importantly would just be hard to achieve. Now there are many websites like the desired game that have been blcoked by administration, so finding a way for it not to be blocked would be difficult and possibly out of their control. If you want to argue that it can be used on personal devices, that doesn't help. Personal device already have major competition, why would someone pick this game over another a major game?

      <b>3. Privacy Screen</b><br>
      The goal of this product is to hide your computer screen when someone unwanted looks at it. This could be useful and get you out of certain situations, however many issue could arise, a definite way that someone is looking at your screen in improbable to achieve. Another major issue is this could cause a loss of unsaved progress and tamper with your work. It is a great idea in theory, but in practice, there are many issues that need to be covered.

      <b>4. Code Converter</b><br>
      This project is revolutionary and can change the world of coding forever. However, for a student in highschool, knowing how to code in this many languages and have a computer be able to recognise and rewrite seems like a monumentous task. This project might be discouraging after the first couple of weeks, and recognitino among code would be seemingly difficult. Im not sure how many working parts there are but it seems like not enough on the surface for enough people.

      <b>5. ID attendance</b><br>
      This prject is practical, attendance at school needs to be update with our new technology. This idea is practical and the ideas are good, hoever the technology isnt the best or most creative. For example, we already have this technology in our librarys, so there are no new technologies that can really be implemented here. Other than that, the idea is useful and practical, unfortunately it just isnt something we havent seen before.

      <b>6. Skyward 2.0</b><br>
      I agree that skyward is outdated and does need a revamp, and im sure most student will agree with me. Making a new platform for students to view the numbers that determine the rest of their life is necessary so I can see my failsures in better and more readable quality. The one issue is there is lack of planning and description withing his business idea. Making a whole new website with databases would also be really hard to manage large groups of information at the moment, on top of convincing the school it should transitino from skyward.

      <b>7. Scuffed SquareSpace</b><br>
      Many people that arent experienced with coding or HTML in general may have trouble wanting to make a website. The demand for front end developers is reltivaley high, but most companies also find it cheaper to use websites that host other websites easier. Wix and Square space already do this and have gain a major following, so creating a website like those is not only ambitious but can be hard to emerge among the competition.

      <b>8. GOOSE SIMULATOR</b><br>
      The gaming department is very competitve and hard to pull off, but when goose simulator came out, it drew in many players. This goose game is not exactly revolutionary, but the idea is funny and creative. I think it would be a fun project to work on, but unfortunately there is no practical use other than a video game. This could be very hard to market.

      <b>9. Drowsiness Detector</b><br>
      The idea is fun and would be a cool project to make, the only issue is practicality. There are still some unencountered problems that mgiht be difficult to overcome as well as using the practical use of the product. Who would use it? Why? The uselessness of the product is the only thing turning me away from it.

      <b>10. Face ID Attendance</b><br>
      Lastly, I belive this is the most innovate, least competed with product in the pool. This product is something with practical use and good reason, save time in class and minimalize human error. This product works by taking the facial recognition of students and regerstering data in a database to mark whether they are present or not. This creates a revolutionary change to the classroom and could ultimately be a project that leaves a mark. That is why I chose to work on this project.
