	<span style="font-weight:bold">Concept:</span> This project was based around a crime, and the goal was to solve the crime using cybersecurity. It revolved around a man named Koscher, who was allegedly redistributing illegal content to countries around the world, and my goal as a cyber securist was to predict the location and time of the next distribution.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight:bold">Motivation:</span> My greatest motivation for this project was my interest in working in the cyber security field. I think the cyber security field is interesting and a doable path for me to follow. I enjoy putting in the work for these sorts of things because htey seem like a puzzle to me, and thats something I enjoy doing.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight:bold">Conclusion:</span> By the end of hte chase, I had created an md5 saltless decrypter, for converted text files into png files, and worked around red herrings to find out the next distribution. The next distribution was headed to Jordan, and due to the cyber chase I was able to prove Koschers guilt. This was a great introduction to cyber securty and only made me want to dig deeper.<br>
