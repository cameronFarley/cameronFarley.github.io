      <h2>Model Schedule</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
	<span style="font-weight:bold">Concept:</span> My goal for this project was to work with other developers in order to create a working Mock Schedule. I worked with other front end developers to create a stylish looking webpage. This mock schedule would compete against others that would be release to all of the students of the school so they can practice arena scheduling, which is a program that allows a student to pick their corses and blocks for their next school year.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight:bold">Motivation:</span> My main motivator for this project was the desire to learn. Granted this was a grade and all, my main motivator was that I could use my time how I wanted and pick what I wanted to learn, and I picked to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My main focus was to learn how those three languages could build off of eachother and how to use them to build a website.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-weight:bold">Conclusion:</span> This project really broaded my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Working with front-end allowed me to take a peek into the website building world and learn how to do things like animations and page linking. This project was my first big computer science project and I learned a lot, not only in coding, bust also how to work with a group of other developers on the same project.<br>
